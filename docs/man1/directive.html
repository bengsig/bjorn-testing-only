&minus; RWP*Load Simulator directives</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>$directive:value</b></p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Directives are
read while scanning the input files to rwloadsim and most
are used to modify the behavior during parsing and code
generation. They are expressly <i>not</i> executed and are
as such not provided to the rwloadsim language parser.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All directives
are initiated by <b>$</b> and a sequence of lower case
letters, and most then have <b>:</b> and another sequence of
non-whitespace characters that are the directive value. This
page documents all ordinary directives.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some directives
differ slightly in syntax are are documented in these
separate pages: For conditional compilation using <b>$if
$then $else $endif</b> see conditional(1rwl). For include
file processing using <b>$include</b> see include(1rwl). For
option handling see either useroption(1rwl).</p>

<h2>DIRECTIVES
<a name="DIRECTIVES"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>$iformat:%&lt;format&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This directive sets the printf
format used whenever an integer is converted to a string;
the default value is &quot;%ld&quot;. Only formats that
actually can be used to convert integers are accepted, and a
warning will be displayed if the conversion isn&rsquo;t
valid for a (small) set of verification values.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Some useful
values may be: <b>$iformat:%08ld</b> which makes the string
representation of integers have up to 8 leading zeros. The
directive <b>$iformat:%20ld</b> will cause the string
representation of integers to have 20 characters.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The size of the
internal buffer used to store the string representation of
an integer is at least 30 characters, and rwloadsim ensures
the buffer is not written beyond its size.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that in
the following code snippet:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">integer x :=
123; <br>
$iformat:%08ld <br>
printline x;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">the output will
be &rsquo;123&rsquo; and not &rsquo;00000123&rsquo;. The
reason is that the string representation of the integer x is
generated when the value 123 is assigned to it, which is
before the $iformat directive. If you want the directive to
be effective in this case, you need to include it before the
assignment:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$iformat:%08d
<br>
integer x := 123; <br>
printline x;</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>$dformat:%&lt;format&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This is similar to $iformat,
except it is used when the string representation of double
variables is needed; similar restrictions apply. The default
dformat is %.2f, and the same minimum 30 characters buffers
is used. As an example use <b>$dformat:%.6f</b> to cause
string representation of doubles to have 6 digits after the
decimal point.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>$randseed:&lt;hexdigits&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The random number generator is
normally provided a seed from /dev/urandom, such that
different executions of rwloadsim generates different random
values. If you want repeatable results, you can use this
directive; the argument is any sequence of hexadecimal
digits (0-9, a-f, A-F); up to twelve of these are used as
the unsigned short entries in the xsubi[] array used by
erand48(3) and nrand48(3). The random numbers in threads
will also be repeatable as they are generated by a
thread-specific permutation of bits in the xsubi[] array.
You can optionally put 0x or 0X in front of the up to twelve
hexadecimal digits.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>$startseconds:&lt;double&gt;
<br>
$clockstart:&lt;double&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">These directive serves the same
purpose as the <b>-c</b> option and they set the common
start time as a number of seconds after starting rwloadsim.
The directive must be used before the results database is
declared. The two directives have identical behavior; the
reason for having both is that the rwloadsim developer was
using both of the two terms in various circumstances.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>$debugon:&lt;hexdigits&gt;
<br>
$debugoff:&lt;hexdigits&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The debugon directive has the
same effect as using the <b>-D</b> option to the rwloadsim
executable; debugoff reverses it. Both of these take a
string of hexadecimal digits as argument; 0x or 0X in front
of them is optional.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>$mute:&lt;integer&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This directive will mute the
rwl error with the number provided.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>$oraerror:stop
<br>
$oraerror:continue</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The first of these tells
rwloadsim to stop as soon as SQL execution gives any ORA-
error. Note that doing so can imply more errors during the
actual program termination. The second tells rwloadsim to
continue when ORA- errors are found during SQL execution.
This is the default.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>$ora01013:continue
<br>
$ora01013:stop</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Normally, ctrl-c leads to a
controlled stop of the executing rwloadsim process although
the exact details of how clean-up is done cannot by
guaranteed. If you want rwloadsim to continue after
receiving an ORA-01013, use the first directive. The second,
which is the default, undoes this.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>$bindoffset:0</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Change bind by position offset
to start at zero; this is primarily useful if you are
running with event 10046 tracing where bind value dumping
starts at #0. With this directive set, the bind position
actually used with the OCIBindByPos call is one larger than
the position set at bind or bindout. The effect of the
directive can be reversed by using <b>$bindoffset:1</b>
which is the default. Note that this directive has no impact
on the numbering of select list elements used with
define.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>$maxcode:N
<br>
$maxident:N <br>
$readbuffer:N</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">These set the maximum size of
the code, the maximum number of identifiers, or the size of
the buffer used to read lines of text using <b>readline</b>
respectively. They serve the same purpose as the <b>-I</b>,
<b>-C</b> and <b>-B</b> options and can be used in startup
files or using the <b>$longoption</b> directive in the first
file named with a .rwl suffix.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>$statistics:basic
<br>
$statistics:histograms <br>
$statistics:all</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">These have the same purpose as
the <b>-s</b>, <b>-ss</b>, and <b>-sss</b> options
respectively. They need to be used before the repository
database is declared.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>$setaction:on
<br>
$setaction:reset <br>
$setaction:off</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The $setaction directives
control setting the action (in v$session.action). When on,
the action is set to the procedure name when a database
session is acquired from a pool or a dedicated connection is
being used; the action name is set using the OCI_ATTR_ACTION
attribute of the session and is therefore sent to the
database during the first coming actual round trip. When
reset is specified, the action name is reset when the
session is released or a dedicated connection no longer is
in use; using reset implies an extra otherwise unnecessary
round trip to the database.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">You can get the
same behavior using the <b>-S</b> option to rwloadsim.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>$oerstatistics:on
<br>
$oerstatistics:off <br>
$oerstatistics:N</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">These directives controls
saving of ORA- error statistics similar to the
<b>--oer-statistics</b> option. They can be used to turn
saving of error statistics on and off or to set the maximum
number of errors saved (per thread); the default is 50.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>$queue:on
<br>
$queue:off</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">These have the same effect as
the <b>-Q</b> and <b>-N</b> options; the default is that
queuing simulation using a backlog is off.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>$errortime:on
<br>
$errortime:off</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The first of these has the same
effect as the <b>-W</b> option, i.e. to augment all
execution time errors with a timestamp measured as the
number of seconds since clock start. It is primarily used as
a debugging tool if the exact time of errors is needed. The
second directive turns this off.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>$nameexpand:off
<br>
$nameexpand:on</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The former of these has the
same effect as the <b>--no-nameexpand</b> option; the latter
turns file name expansion using environment variable on.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>$eventnotify:on
<br>
$eventnotify:off</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The former has the same effect
as the <b>--event-notify</b> option; the latter undoes
<b>--event-notify</b> if found on the command line. These
are only available in the startup file or via $longoption
directive in the first file named with a .rwl suffix.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>$useroption:name
<br>
$userswitch:name <br>
$longoption:option[=value]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Refer to useroption(1rwl).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">You can get the
same behavior using the <b>-S</b> option to rwloadsim.</p>
